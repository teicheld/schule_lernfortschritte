****** Thread Objects ******
Each thread is associated with an instance of the class Thread. There are two
basic strategies for using Thread objects to create a concurrent application.
    * To directly control thread creation and management, simply instantiate
      Thread each time the application needs to initiate an asynchronous task.
    * To abstract thread management from the rest of your application, pass the
      application's tasks to an executor.
This section documents the use of Thread objects. Executors are discussed with
other high-level_concurrency_objects.
