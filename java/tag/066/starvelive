****** Starvation and Livelock ******
Starvation and livelock are much less common a problem than deadlock, but are
still problems that every designer of concurrent software is likely to
encounter.
***** Starvation *****
Starvation describes a situation where a thread is unable to gain regular
access to shared resources and is unable to make progress. This happens when
shared resources are made unavailable for long periods by "greedy" threads. For
example, suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a
long time to return. If one thread invokes this method frequently, other
threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will
often be blocked.
***** Livelock *****
A thread often acts in response to the action of another thread. If the other
thread's action is also a response to the action of another thread, then
livelock may result. As with deadlock, livelocked threads are unable to make
further progress. However, the threads are not blocked  they are simply too
busy responding to each other to resume work. This is comparable to two people
attempting to pass each other in a corridor: Alphonse moves to his left to let
Gaston pass, while Gaston moves to his right to let Alphonse pass. Seeing that
they are still blocking each other, Alphone moves to his right, while Gaston
moves to his left. They're still blocking each other, so...
