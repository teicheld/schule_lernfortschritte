## Task: 

Add a readList method to ListOfNumbers.java. This method should read in int values from a file, print each value, and append them to the end of the vector. You should catch all appropriate errors. You will also need a text file containing numbers to read in.

### My solution

readList(Sting[] filename) {
	IntergerList list1 = new IntergerList();
	String[] buffer = new String();
	try 
	{
		FileReader file = new FileReader();
		while ((buffer = file.nextLine()) != null ) {
			list1.add(buffer);
		}
	} catch (FileNotFoundException e)
	{
		System.out.println("file " + filename + " does not exist.");
		System.out.println(e);
	}
}
