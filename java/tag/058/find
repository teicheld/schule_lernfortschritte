****** Finding Files ******
If you have ever used a shell script, you have most likely used pattern
matching to locate files. In fact, you have probably used it extensively. If
you haven't used it, pattern matching uses special characters to create a
pattern and then file names can be compared against that pattern. For example,
in most shell scripts, the asterisk, *, matches any number of characters. For
example, the following command lists all the files in the current directory
that end in .html:
% ls *.html
The java.nio.file package provides programmatic support for this useful
feature. Each file system implementation provides a PathMatcher. You can
retrieve a file system's PathMatcher by using the getPathMatcher(String) method
in the FileSystem class. The following code snippet fetches the path matcher
for the default file system:
String pattern = ...;
PathMatcher matcher =
    FileSystems.getDefault().getPathMatcher("glob:" + pattern);
The string argument passed to getPathMatcher specifies the syntax flavor and
the pattern to be matched. This example specifies glob syntax. If you are
unfamiliar with glob syntax, see What_is_a_Glob.
Glob syntax is easy to use and flexible but, if you prefer, you can also use
regular expressions, or regex, syntax. For further information about regex, see
the Regular_Expressions lesson. Some file system implementations might support
other syntaxes.
If you want to use some other form of string-based pattern matching, you can
create your own PathMatcher class. The examples in this page use glob syntax.
Once you have created your PathMatcher instance, you are ready to match files
against it. The PathMatcher interface has a single method, matches, that takes
a Path argument and returns a boolean: It either matches the pattern, or it
does not. The following code snippet looks for files that end in .java or
.class and prints those files to standard output:
PathMatcher matcher =
    FileSystems.getDefault().getPathMatcher("glob:*.{java,class}");

Path filename = ...;
if (matcher.matches(filename)) {
    System.out.println(filename);
}
***** Recursive Pattern Matching *****
Searching for files that match a particular pattern goes hand-in-hand with
walking a file tree. How many times do you know a file is somewhere on the file
system, but where? Or perhaps you need to find all files in a file tree that
have a particular file extension.
The Find example does precisely that. Find is similar to the UNIX find utility,
but has pared down functionally. You can extend this example to include other
functionality. For example, the find utility supports the -prune flag to
exclude an entire subtree from the search. You could implement that
functionality by returning SKIP_SUBTREE in the preVisitDirectory method. To
implement the -L option, which follows symbolic links, you could use the four-
argument walkFileTree method and pass in the FOLLOW_LINKS enum (but make sure
that you test for circular links in the visitFile method).
To run the Find application, use the following format:
% java Find <path> -name "<glob_pattern>"
The pattern is placed inside quotation marks so any wildcards are not
interpreted by the shell. For example:
% java Find . -name "*.html"
Here is the source code for the Find example:
/**
 * Sample code that finds files that match the specified glob pattern.
 * For more information on what constitutes a glob pattern, see
 * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob
 *
 * The file or directories that match the pattern are printed to
 * standard out.  The number of matches is also printed.
 *
 * When executing this application, you must put the glob pattern
 * in quotes, so the shell will not expand any wild cards:
 *              java Find . -name "*.java"
