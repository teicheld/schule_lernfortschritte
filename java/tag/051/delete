****** Deleting a File or Directory ******
You can delete files, directories or links. With symbolic links, the link is
deleted and not the target of the link. With directories, the directory must be
empty, or the deletion fails.
The Files class provides two deletion methods.
The delete(Path) method deletes the file or throws an exception if the deletion
fails. For example, if the file does not exist a NoSuchFileException is thrown.
You can catch the exception to determine why the delete failed as follows:
try {
    Files.delete(path);
} catch (NoSuchFileException x) {
    System.err.format("%s: no such" + " file or directory%n", path);
} catch (DirectoryNotEmptyException x) {
    System.err.format("%s not empty%n", path);
} catch (IOException x) {
    // File permission problems are caught here.
    System.err.println(x);
}
The deleteIfExists(Path) method also deletes the file, but if the file does not
exist, no exception is thrown. Failing silently is useful when you have
multiple threads deleting files and you don't want to throw an exception just
because one thread did so first.
