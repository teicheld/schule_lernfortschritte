### Instructions

from Wikipedia:
The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences.
It differs from problems of finding common substrings: unlike substrings, subsequences are not required to occupy consecutive positions within the original sequences.
Task

Write a function lcs that accepts two strings and returns their longest common subsequence as a string. Performance matters.
Examples

lcs( "abcdef", "abc" ) => "abc"
lcs( "abcdef", "acf" ) => "acf"
lcs( "132535365", "123456789" ) => "12356"
lcs( "abcdefghijklmnopq", "apcdefghijklmnobq" ) => "acdefghijklmnoq"

Testing

This is a performance version of xDranik's kata of the same name.
This kata, however, has much more full and heavy testing. Intermediate random tests have string arguments of 20 characters; hard random tests 40 characters; extreme 60 characters (characters are chosen out of 36 different ones).

The reference algorithm solves all (12 fixed, 72 intermediate, 24 hard, 12 extreme) tests within ~150ms. The example algorithm without memoisation would take ~15000ms.
Notes

The subsequences of "abc" are "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc".
"" is a valid subsequence in this kata, and a possible return value.
All inputs will be valid.
Two strings may have more than one longest common subsequence. When this occurs, return any of them.

lcs( string0, string1 ) === lcs( string1, string0 )
